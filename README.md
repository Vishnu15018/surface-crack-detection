# surface-crack-detection
this project repo conatins surface crack detection 
1. segdecnet++
    i.use unet-like architecture with sse skip connections along with classification module
    ii. Classification module output is used for adjusting the thresholding
2. Used Unet and Vgg-unet, LinkNet model.
3. The dataset used in the paper is from this paper.
